In this project, I created a simple ETL workflow with Alteryx combining a csv and xlsx files containing dummy ordering data. 


# 1. Extraction 
During this step I extracted data from a both a Excel and csv files. In larger workflows, data will be extracted from various sources such as AWS S3 buckets, databases, zip files, and json files to name a few. During the extraction phase, I merged the datasets based on positon.
